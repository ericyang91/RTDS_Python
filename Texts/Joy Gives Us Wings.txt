Title: Joy
TEDA International School
YEAR: 2003

Joy gives us wings to be free from this mortal cage
And joy is the means of flight through this limitless space
So fly, soar on wings of pure ecstasy
Through the realms above and believe
Your creations has begun
If there ever was a time to be happy
(To be happy, yeah~)
What other seasons then, can there be?
(What are you waiting for?)
Well it's destiny, (Joy), life is meant to be (Joy), for happiness not misery
It's reality, the way to be, true liberty, nothing can stop us now!
