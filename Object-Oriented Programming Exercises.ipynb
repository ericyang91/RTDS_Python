    "In Python, how do class attributes differ from other attributes of class, and what are the differences between the class method and static method?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:** \n",
    "    - Class attributes are attributes defined within a class but outside the \\_\\init\\_\\_ constructor, which initializes an instance of the class. This means that the class attributes are not bound to a specific instance/object of the class, but is shared across all instances of the class. This also implies that any changes made to the class attributes will affect all instances of the class that are initialized. On the other hand, an instance attribute of a class may be representative of a particular instance of the class. Making modifications to the attribute may only reflect on that particular instance/object. An example of a class attribute of the 'Reptiles' class can be their 'cold-bloodedness', whereas an attribute of an instance of Reptiles, 'Crested Gecko', can be 'tail does not regenerate'.\n",
    "    - Class methods, which are defined using the @classmethod decorator, are often used to access or modify class-level attributes (class attributes) and methods. They take 'cls' as their first parameter. This indicates that class methods access class itself and not individual instances. They can be used to access or perform operations relevant to the entire class. Another useful functionality is the ability to create instances of a class in a different way than the \\_\\init\\_\\_ constructor. Static methods, on the other hand, are defined using the @staticmethod decorator. They do not take 'cls' or 'self' as their parameters. Unlike class methods that have access to class-level data, the static methods do not have access or the ability to modify class-level or instance-level data. They are often used to perform tasks that are related to the class but are independent of class-level or instance-level data.\n",
    "    - Example Usage:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "            class ZooAnimals: # Define a class\n",
    "                count = 0 # This is the class-level attribute that applies to the entire class\n",
    "\n",
    "                def __init__(self, species, habitat, diet):\n",
    "                    self.species = species\n",
    "                    self.habitat = habitat\n",
    "                    self.diet = diet\n",
    "                    self.__class__.count += 1 # Accesses the class-level attribute and modifies the animal count as new instances are created\n",
    "\n",
    "                @classmethod # Using decorator\n",
    "                def animal_count(cls): # The parameter is the class itself because it is accessing the class-level data\n",
    "                    return f'There are {cls.count} animals in the zoo.'\n",

    "                    return cls(species, habitat, diet)\n",

    "## Q2\n",
    "Rational numbers are those real numbers that can be represented as a quotient of two integers such as a/b, which can then be represented by a pair of integers a and b. Given the class definition of rational numbers below, add a definition of the dunder method \\_\\_le\\_\\_() so the expression rational(3, 11) <= rational(7, 25) would work.\n",

    "    self.n = n\n",
    "    self.d = d\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Interpretation of the question:** The question asks for the understanding of how dunder methods can be used in Python OOP to modify/override the behaviour of class instances with built-in operators and functions. For instance, the dunder method \\_\\_str\\_\\_ can be used to override how an object behaves when it is converted to a string when it is printed. The question defines rational numbers as real numbers that can be represented as a quotient of two integers that can then be represented by a pair of integers a, b. Examples of rational numbers include rational(1, 12), rational(-5/3), etc. The question then goes on to ask how we can use the dunder method \\_\\_le\\_\\_ (less than or equl to) within a class definition to modify how an instance of the class example behaves when the comparison operator <= is used to compare two rational numbers. \n",
    "- **Answer with explanation:** The \\_\\_le\\_\\_ method is used to define the behaviour of <= operator (less than or equal to) when comparing two instances/objects of class Rational. Along with 'self' (the current instance of the rational number), it also passes 'other', which is another instance/object of class Rational that we are comparing against. To clarify, we are comparing to see if the self instance is less than or equal to the other instance. Instead of a straight comparison of two rational numbers each with a numerator and a denominator, we first do cross multiplication to avoid the potential inaccuracy of floating-number comparisons. The result of the comparison is then printed out. By doing so, we make sure that the expression rational(3, 11) <= rational(7, 25) works.\n",

    "- **Interpretation of the question:** The question is asking for our understanding of the roles of decorators within a class definition, and the use of private attributes. Decorators can be used within a class definition to wrap around functions to modify their behaviour. A few examples of decorators that are used within class definitions include '@classmethod', '@staticmethod', '@property', '@property_name.setter', @property_name.deleter', etc. Each of these decorators wrap around function definitions inside a class to serve specific purpose. A private attribute is an attribute of a class instance that are intended to be hidden, or restricted from direct outside access. Unlike the public or protected attributes, private attributes are strictly enforced in Python. It assists with data encapsulation, an important attribute of Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    "- **Answer with explanation:** Decorator @property utilizes the built-in property() function as a decorator to define how the fullname property, which is composed of an instance's firstname and lastname attributes, is accessed. This decorator essentially acts as the getter method for the fullname property, allowing it to be accessed like an attribute while retrieving the combined value of firstname and lastname. The @fullname.setter decorator utilizes the built-in property() function to define a setter method for the fullname property. This decorator wraps around a method named fullname that takes a parameter fullname. The method splits the fullname string into firstname and lastname, and assigns these values to the instance's firstname and lastname attributes. Essentially, this decorator allows you to set the fullname property and update the underlying attributes accordingly. The _student_id attribute in the example is a protected attribute, indicated by the single leading underscore. Attributes with a single leading underscore are intended to be protected, meaning they should not be accessed directly from outside the class. Attributes with double leading underscores are considered private, providing a stronger form of encapsulation. Python strinctly enforces the encapsulation of private attributes. In this case, _student_id is a good example of encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP), as it is intended to be restricted from direct outside access and modify only through class methods or properties. The _student_id attribute is intended to be private."

    "- **Interpretation of the question:** The question is asking to identify and explain some key techniques used and when these techniques can be useful. In the text of Chapter 8, it is asking for our understanding of the \\_\\_call\\_\\_ function and how it is used when we utilize a class as a decorator of a function. It is also asking us for our understanding of the usefulness of using a class as a decorator to modify a function that it wraps around without changing the original definition of the function.\n",
    "- **Answer with explanation:** The script uses DecoClass as a decorator to wrap around the function, 'myFunction' to modify its behaviour. A class can be used as a decorator to modify the behaviour of a function it wraps by using the \\_\\_call\\_\\_ method without changing the original definition of the function. This method is invoked each time the function is called and an instance of the class is initiated via the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method and the function to be decorated is passed into it. When a class has a \\_\\_call\\_\\_ method in its definition, it is treated as a callable object. Therefore, when the function that the class decorates gets called, the \\_\\_call\\_\\_ method gets executed instead. It ultimately modifies the behaviour of the function. In our example, it prints `<<Script before>>` and `<<Script after>>` before and after the script that myFunction prints. Class as decorator has multiple uses. First, it allows for complex logic when modifying the behaviour of the function it wraps. It is able to take advantage of different methods, attributes, etc. without needing to modify the original definition of the function they wrap around. Also, it is modular and can be extended through inheritance. This means that its functionality can be expanded by building on multiple classes through inheritence. In addition, it allows state persistence by storing data in instance attributes, which makes it easy to track previous function calls or maintain a running total. This can help in maintaining an efficient program. Also, another noticeable technique that is utilized in the example is the use of *args and **kwargs as the parameters of the \\_\\_call\\_\\_ method. This gives the flexibility of accepting decorated functions that take different numbers of positional arguments and keyword arguments.\n",

Within the class, the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ constructor takes as its parameters 'type' and 'amount' to initialize an instance of the class, which represents a transaction. Each instance of the class, or each transaction, has attributes such as the time of the transaction, the type of the transaction, and the amount of fund involved. The time of the transaction is calculated by using the 'datetime' module's datetime.now(). We can also add the a \\_\\_call\\_\\_ method within the class to enable users to call like a function an instance that has been initialized or the different attributes of the instance. We can define the \\_\\_call\\_\\_ method to take a parameter called 'check' that takes 'summary' as its default value. Depending on the value of 'check', which can be one of 'type', 'amount', 'time', or the default value 'summary', we can return just like a function the different attributes of the Transaction instance.   \n",

Within the class, the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ constructor takes as its parameters 'firstname', 'lastname', and 'account_number' to initialize an instance of the class, which represents a bank account. Each instance of the class, or each transaction, has additional attributes such as the account balance, which has an intial value of '0', and a dictionary to store transactions and their type and amount. I have also added a class method decorator to provide an alternative way of creating an instance. This method takes the fullname of the account holder instead of first and last name separately. The add_new_transaction method takes the type and the amount of fund involved in the transaction as arguments and updates the account balance and the transaction dictionary accordingly. For money-out transactions such as 'withdrawal' and 'transfer-out', an error message displays if the amount in the transaction is greater than available balance. The method, display_all_transactions, I looped through the dictionary that stores all transactions to store the elements in a string as a list. Then, I joined the string elements in the list by using '\\n' as the joining element and printed out the transactions. The display_account_balance displays the updated balance.   \n",

    "**Interpretation and analysis:** The question asks us to design a terminal-based, user-interactive teller system that allows the user to check their account balance, perform transactions, and view all account transactions. The program will need three major sections to function: a class that defines bank accounts, a class that defines transactions, and a user-interactive teller model. The critical skill required is the ability to integrate these three components effectively. The user-interactive teller model should be able to create instances of both the bank account and the transaction classes. Methods within the bank account class should retrieve and store instances of the transaction class. Since this is a user-interactive system, it is crucial for the program to validate user inputs.   \n",
    "**Algorithm:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Define a BankAccount class with a constructor to initialize instances with the following attributes:\n",

    "    - account_balance: The current balance, initialized to 0.\n",

    "        - Depending on the type of transaction, do the following:\n",
    "            - 'Deposit' and 'Transfer-In': Increase the account balance by the amount.\n",
    "            - 'Withdrawal' and 'Transfer-Out': Check if the balance is greater than the transaction amount.\n",
    "                - If greater, decrease the account balance by the amount.\n",
    "                - If less, return a warning message: 'Insufficient funds.'\n",
    "            - Store each valid transaction in a list that records transactions. Each transaction is an instance of the Transaction class.\n",
